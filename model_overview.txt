Discrete cascade model — overview
==================================

This repo holds the model specification and Python code for "discrete stochastic cascade dynamics on finite graphs with irreversible energy depletion." The formal work appears in two papers (arXiv); here we give a short, self-contained summary.

What the model is
-----------------
A discrete-time stochastic process on a graph. At each site you have:
  - X, Y: counts of two excitation types (asymmetry: X–Y and X–X allowed; Y–Y forbidden)
  - Beta: local capacity energy (finite, depletable)
  - S: structural state (evolves with interactions and bonds)

Constants: k (energy release per X–Y interaction), C (ripple threshold), Delta (overshoot), lambda (leakage rate), mu (bond rate).

Update order (one time step)
----------------------------
Interaction (stochastic X–Y events) -> energy release (Beta drops) -> ripple F = |S(n) - 2S(n-1) + S(n-2)| -> regime: if F in (C, C+Delta) then leakage; if F >= C+Delta then explosion (pair creation) -> bonds (X–Y pairs can form bonds) -> S and diffusion updates.

Main results (Paper I)
----------------------
- Total Beta decreases strictly every step (irreversible).
- Activity is bounded in time; the system reaches an absorbing state.
- As Beta -> 0, X and Y go to zero and F -> 0; final state is a frozen residue of the last cascade.

Paper II shows that species asymmetry (X vs Y, different roles) is necessary for structural hierarchy in this class of models.

How to run
----------
From model_simulation/: install numpy, matplotlib (see requirements.txt), then run e.g. run_simulation.py, run_bigbang.py, run_cosmology.py. See model_simulation/README.md and figures/README.txt for details and how to regenerate the figures.

Papers
------
- Paper I: Discrete Stochastic Cascade Dynamics on Finite Graphs with Irreversible Energy Depletion
- Paper II: Necessity of Species Asymmetry for Structural Hierarchy in Discrete Stochastic Cascade Models
