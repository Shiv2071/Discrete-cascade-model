# I. Core Variables

Discrete space: points ( p )
Discrete evolution step: ( n )

State variables at each point:

* ( X(p,n) \in {0,1,2,...} )  → X excitation count
* ( Y(p,n) \in {0,1,2,...} )  → Y excitation count
* ( \Beta(p,n) \ge 0 ) → local capacity energy
* ( S(p,n) ) → structural state (can encode bonds)

Global constants:

* ( k ) → Beta release per XY interaction
* ( C ) → ripple threshold
* ( \Delta ) → overshoot margin
* ( \lambda ) → leakage rate
* ( \mu ) → bond formation rate

---

# II. Interaction Layer (Stochastic)

XY interactions are random.

Let expected interaction rate:

[
R_{XY}(p,n) = \alpha , X(p,n), Y(p,n)
]

Where ( \alpha ) is interaction coefficient.

Number of actual interactions is stochastic with mean ( R_{XY} ).

---

# III. Beta Release Rule

Each XY interaction releases energy:

[
\Delta \Beta_{\text{release}}(p,n) = k \cdot N_{XY}(p,n)
]

Beta update:

[
\Beta(p,n+1) =
\Beta(p,n)

* k \cdot N_{XY}(p,n)
* L(p,n)
  ]

Where leakage term ( L(p,n) ) defined below.

Total Beta strictly decreases:

[
\sum_p \Beta(p,n+1)
<
\sum_p \Beta(p,n)
]

Irreversible.

---

# IV. Ripple Frequency (Gamma Measure)

Define ripple intensity as discrete temporal curvature:

[
F(p,n) =
|S(p,n) - 2S(p,n-1) + S(p,n-2)|
]

This measures oscillatory intensity.

---

# V. Leakage vs Explosion Regime

If:

[
C < F(p,n) < C + \Delta
]

Then slow leakage:

[
L(p,n) = \lambda , F(p,n)
]

If:

[
F(p,n) \ge C + \Delta
]

Then explosion event:

* Create new XY pairs:
  [
  X(p,n+1) += m
  ]
  [
  Y(p,n+1) += m
  ]

* Consume additional Beta.

Explosion increases excitation density locally.

---

# VI. Bond Formation

XY pairs can form bonds:

[
B(p,n) = \mu \cdot X(p,n) \cdot Y(p,n)
]

Bond formation:

* Reduces free X and Y counts
* Creates composite state in S
* Consumes Beta
* Bond obeys same ripple + Beta rules
* Bonds are metastable

---

# VII. Structural Evolution (S update)

Structural state evolves from interactions:

[
S(p,n+1)
========

S(p,n)
+
\gamma_1 N_{XY}(p,n)
+
\gamma_2 B(p,n)
]

Ripple emerges from S evolution.

---

# VIII. Macroscopic Consequences

Because:

* Beta decreases monotonically
* Interaction rate ∝ X·Y
* Ripple decreases as Beta decreases
* Explosion frequency drops over time
* Excitation density falls

We get:

[
F_{\text{avg}}(n+1)
<
F_{\text{avg}}(n)
]

Eventually:

[
\Beta(p,n) \to 0
]
[
X(p,n), Y(p,n) \to 0
]
[
F(p,n) \to 0
]

System reaches absorbing frozen state.

Final configuration:

Random residue of last cascade.

---

# IX. Interpretation of Layers

### Layer 1 — Micro Field

Stochastic XY interactions.

### Layer 2 — Energy Layer

Beta released per interaction.
Irreversible depletion.

### Layer 3 — Instability Control

Ripple threshold governs leakage vs explosion.

### Layer 4 — Structural Emergence

Pair creation and bonding build transient clumps.

### Layer 5 — Thermodynamic Arrow

Beta monotonic decrease → cooling.

---

# X. Global Invariant

Only strict invariant:

[
\sum_p \Beta(p,n+1)
<
\sum_p \Beta(p,n)
]

Monotonic decay.

Everything else is emergent consequence.

---

# XII. Derivations and Key Equations

Below are derived relationships and explicit equations that follow from the rules in I–XI. Notation: p = site, n = time step; all quantities non-negative unless stated.

---

## 12.1 Interaction rate (from II)

Expected number of XY interactions at site p, step n:

[
R_{XY}(p,n) = \alpha \cdot X(p,n) \cdot Y(p,n)
]

(Comma in original notation interpreted as multiplication.) Realized count N_{XY}(p,n) is stochastic with mean R_{XY}; e.g. Poisson with that mean, capped by min(X,Y).

---

## 12.2 Beta update (from III, V)

Energy is consumed by interactions and by leakage/explosion, not released into Beta. Single-site update:

[
\Beta(p,n+1) = \Beta(p,n) - k \cdot N_{XY}(p,n) - L(p,n) - M(p,n) - \kappa \cdot B(p,n)
]

Where:
* L(p,n) = \lambda \cdot F(p,n)  when C < F(p,n) < C + \Delta, else 0 in quiescent; in explosion regime leakage still applies.
* M(p,n) = explosion energy cost (e.g. \eta \cdot m if m new pairs created).
* \kappa = energy cost per bond.

Clamp \Beta(p,n+1) to \geq 0. Total depletion at step n:

[
D(n) = \sum_p \bigl[ k N_{XY}(p,n) + L(p,n) + M(p,n) + \kappa B(p,n) \bigr]
]

So:

[
\sum_p \Beta(p,n+1) = \sum_p \Beta(p,n) - D(n) \leq \sum_p \Beta(p,n)
]

Equality only when D(n)=0 (no interactions, no leakage, no explosion, no bonds). Hence global monotonic decrease.

---

## 12.3 Explosion count and cost (from V)

Let overshoot be O(p,n) = F(p,n) - C when F(p,n) \geq C + \Delta. Number of new XY pairs created:

[
m(p,n) = \left\lfloor \frac{O(p,n)}{\Delta} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{F(p,n)-C}{\Delta} \right\rfloor
]

Energy consumed by explosion (e.g. \eta per pair):

[
M(p,n) = \eta \cdot m(p,n)
]

If \Beta(p,n) < M(p,n), cap m to what is affordable: m = \lfloor \Beta(p,n)/\eta \rfloor.

---

## 12.4 Ripple as second difference (from IV)

Ripple intensity is the discrete second derivative of S in time:

[
F(p,n) = \bigl| S(p,n) - 2S(p,n-1) + S(p,n-2) \bigr| = \bigl| \Delta^2 S(p,n) \bigr|
]

So F is large where S is oscillating or curving sharply in time.

---

## 12.5 Structural evolution (from VII)

With both XY and XX contributions (extension: X-X allowed, Y-Y forbidden):

[
S(p,n+1) = S(p,n) + \gamma_1 N_{XY}(p,n) + \gamma_{XX} N_{XX}(p,n) + \gamma_2 B(p,n)
]

Ripple F then depends on how these increments change over time.

---

## 12.6 Why total Beta strictly decreases (derivation)

At each step, D(n) \geq 0. If any site has an XY interaction, or leakage (F in (C, C+\Delta)), or explosion (F \geq C+\Delta), or bond formation, then D(n) > 0. So \sum_p \Beta(p,n+1) = \sum_p \Beta(p,n) - D(n) < \sum_p \Beta(p,n) whenever the system is active. With finite initial total Beta, D(n) is bounded below by a positive amount (in expectation) until activity stops; hence after finitely many steps the system must reach a configuration where no further interactions/leakage/explosions/bonds occur — the absorbing state.

---

## 12.7 Why F_avg eventually decreases (heuristic)

As total Beta falls, total activity (sum of N_{XY}, explosions, bonds) must eventually fall. So increments to S become smaller and less frequent. The discrete second difference F = |\Delta^2 S| is driven by those increments; as they shrink and smooth out, F tends to decrease. Thus F_{\text{avg}}(n+1) < F_{\text{avg}}(n) in the long run, until F \leq C everywhere and the system is quiescent.

---

## 12.8 Bond formation (from VI)

Simple form: B(p,n) proportional to co-density, capped by available Beta and by min(X,Y):

[
B(p,n) \leq \min\left( \mu \cdot X(p,n) \cdot Y(p,n),\ \lfloor \Beta(p,n)/\kappa \rfloor,\ X(p,n),\ Y(p,n) \right)
]

Optional (Landau-style): bond only when local “order parameter” \psi = \sqrt{X \cdot Y} and effective “temperature” (e.g. F/C) satisfy an order–disorder condition; then B as above but only when condition holds.

---

## 12.9 Finite activity bound (derivation)

Let E_0 = \sum_p \Beta(p,0). Each XY interaction consumes at least k; each explosion at least \eta; each bond \kappa. So total number of such events over all time is at most on the order of E_0 / \min(k,\eta,\kappa). Hence the process performs only finitely many events almost surely and reaches an absorbing state in finite time.

---

## 12.10 Summary of key equations

* Interaction rate:    R_{XY} = \alpha \cdot X \cdot Y
* Ripple:             F = |S(n) - 2S(n-1) + S(n-2)|
* Leakage:            L = \lambda F  when C < F < C + \Delta
* Explosion pairs:    m = \lfloor (F - C)/\Delta \rfloor when F \geq C + \Delta
* Beta update:        \Beta(n+1) = \Beta(n) - k N_{XY} - L - M - \kappa B  (per site, clamped)
* S update:           S(n+1) = S(n) + \gamma_1 N_{XY} + \gamma_{XX} N_{XX} + \gamma_2 B
* Global invariant:   \sum_p \Beta(p,n+1) \leq \sum_p \Beta(p,n), with strict inequality when active.

# XIII. Relevance to cosmology research

**Symmetry and asymmetry as two sides of one coin.** The picture is not black-and-white: “symmetry” vs “asymmetry” are not two options but two aspects of the same system. The *coin* is the single dynamics—one graph, one update order, one set of rules that apply to both species. The *two sides* are: (i) the underlying symmetry of the framework (same equations, same structure for X and Y in the formalism) and (ii) the built-in asymmetries (Y–Y forbidden, \omega_X \neq \omega_Y) that the theorem shows are necessary. You need the unified, symmetric structure for the asymmetries to even be definable; you need the asymmetries for that structure to sustain non-trivial behaviour. So symmetry and asymmetry are complementary, not opposed—two sides of one coin.

This model can add substantial value to cosmology research in the following ways.

**(1) Asymmetry as a necessary principle.** Cosmology often posits matter–antimatter asymmetry, CP violation, or sectoral asymmetries to explain observation. Here, both asymmetries (forbidden Y–Y and \omega_X \neq \omega_Y) are *proved necessary* for sustained, structured dynamics. That provides a minimal mathematical setting in which “the universe must be asymmetric” is a theorem, not an assumption—a formal analogue relevant to baryogenesis and early-universe model-building.

**(2) Irreversibility and the arrow of time.** Total energy (Beta) is strictly decreasing and total activity is bounded; the process is inherently one-way. The model therefore offers a rigorous toy framework for an arrow of time and irreversible evolution from a discrete, stochastic dynamics—useful for conceptual and pedagogical links to quantum cosmology and the origin of temporal direction.

**(3) Structure from simple rules.** Structure (S) and ripple (F) emerge from local interaction rules and a finite energy budget, without invoking full gravity. That formalises the idea of “structure formation from initial conditions plus dynamics” in a controlled setting, with potential conceptual links to inflation and large-scale structure.

**(4) Runnable Big Bang analogue.** The simulation (e.g. run_bigbang.py) implements a hot, dense initial condition and observes the full arc: burst of activity, growth of structure, then irreversible decay toward absorption. Cosmology has few exactly tractable toy models; this one is simulatable and mathematically characterised, so it can serve as a benchmark or teaching example for Bang-like irreversible dynamics.

**Summary.** The model does not describe real cosmology, but it can add value by (i) deriving asymmetry as necessity, (ii) formalising irreversibility and an arrow of time, (iii) illustrating structure formation from minimal rules, and (iv) providing a runnable, observable Big Bang analogue for research and outreach.

# XIV. Ripple rule, dimension-independence, and the model as a whole system

## 14.1 The ripple rule and why it is significant

**Definition (discrete):**
[
F(p,n) = \bigl| S(p,n) - 2S(p,n-1) + S(p,n-2) \bigr| = \bigl| \Delta^2 S \bigr|
]
—the discrete second difference of the structural state S in time.

**What it does:** It turns the history of structure (S at n, n−1, n−2) into a single number F that measures how sharply S is changing in time (local “curvature” or volatility). That number drives the regime: F ≤ C → quiescent; C < F < C + Δ → leakage; F ≥ C + Δ → explosion (pair creation). So the ripple rule is the *link* between “how structure has been evolving” and “what happens next” (quiet, leak, or explode).

**Why it is significant (not only because it is discrete):**
* Because it is discrete, it is well-defined on a finite graph with no continuum limit required; the model needs no subdivision of space or time.
* In Paper II, \omega_X \neq \omega_Y is *necessary* precisely because the frequency mismatch creates a *beat* in the increments to S; the ripple F = |\Delta^2 S| is what *detects* that beat. If F could not oscillate (e.g. if \omega_X = \omega_Y and \Delta S is monotone), then F \to 0 and the system stays quiescent—no cascades. So the ripple rule is what makes the beat *matter* and what makes the frequency asymmetry *necessary*.
* The same rule can be used in any dimension: F is defined from the *temporal* second difference of S at a site; the graph can be 1D, 2D, 3D, or abstract. Space is encoded in the graph; time is the step index n; F(p,n) does not depend on the spatial dimension of the graph. So the ripple rule is *dimension-independent* in the sense that it applies regardless of the dimension of the spatial substrate.

## 14.2 The model M as a whole system: space(M), time(M), dimension(M)

The discrete cascade model M can be viewed as a *single system* that describes, within itself:
* **Space (M):** the graph \mathcal{G} = (vertices, edges). Space is not \R^d but the structure given by M (sites p, neighbourhoods, diffusion along edges).
* **Time (M):** the step index n. Time is discrete; evolution is the update rule. No external clock.
* **Dimension (M):** the graph can be 1D, 2D, 3D, or higher; the *dimension* is a property of the graph M lives on. The same rules (interaction, ripple, regime, bonds, energy, structure, diffusion) apply regardless of that dimension.

So **inside M as a whole system:** space is “where” (the graph), time is “when” (the step n), and dimension is “how many directions” the graph has—all defined and used *within* M, without requiring an external continuum or a separate notion of spacetime. The ripple rule F = |\Delta^2 S| is part of M and works in any dimension because it only uses the temporal history of S at each site. Combining them: the model M describes space(M) + time(M) + dimension(M) as one coherent system.
